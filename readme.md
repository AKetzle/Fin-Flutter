License: idk how licenses work. Part of the point of this is to make flutter calculations more accessible/distributable for amateurs. Don't claim it's yours if you didn't work on it, don't just sell this for money, don't get me in trouble please :). Distribute/remix/leave in flashdrives in parking lots however you feel like otherwise
